# API Testing with expecto

This repo is part of a talk planned for the AutoStore team on how to test api with the Expecto library. We want to look at different types of tests we can write with expecto like:

- Unit Tests
- Property Based Tests
- Integration Tests
- E2E Tests

Addtionally we will cover the basic setup of expecto and giraffe to make testing a bit less painful. This is not intened to be a comprensive guide at this time and is really just here to capture and share a few ideas.

## Getting Started

The content is split into three directories, each with a fully working solution. 

- **Sample Template** to quickly check setup or config
- **Inital Solution** our starting which also includes the planned exercises 
- **Final Solution** where we should get to by completing each solution (ish)


## Addtional Resources
