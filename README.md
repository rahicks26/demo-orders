# API Testing with Expecto

This repo is part of a talk planned for the AutoStore team on testing APIs with Expecto. We will look at different types of tests we can write with Expecto. Here are some examples:

- Unit Tests
- Property-Based Tests
- Integration Tests
- E2E Tests

Additionally, we will cover the basic setup of Expecto and giraffe to make testing a bit less painful. We do not intend to make this a compressive guide at this time. It is just here to capture and share a few ideas.

## Getting Started

There are three directories, each with a fully working solution. 

- **Sample Template**  which is to help you play with the ideas quickly on your own
- **Initial Solution** our starting which also includes the planned exercises 
- **Final Solution** where we should get to by completing each solution (ish)

## Additional Resources

The ideas here are not my own and use a wide range of other tools from F#. Here are a few resources that directly or indirectly inspired this talk.
